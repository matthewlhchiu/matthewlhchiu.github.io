# Blogroll

A favourite pastime of mine is to read widely. Reading is a wonderful activity that serves the dual purpose of stimulating the mind and nourishing the soul.

I am fortunate that most pieces I come across are often original, illuminating, and help clarify my model of the world. But time and time again, I've found that the very best pieces do one thing very well: they introduce new ideas that alter my fundamental understanding of reality by reframing old ideas. These pieces provide a refreshed sense of meaning and ignite a desire to interrogate and understand what I *really* think. The intellectual joy from reading these exemplary pieces adds a third purpose to reading: an irreplaceable and special pleasure that comes from understanding, conversing, and interrogating the meaning behind the words.

Below, I share some of my favourite writers, bloggers, thinkers, and sources of inspiration.
