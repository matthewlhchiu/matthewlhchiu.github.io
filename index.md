# Welcome
I am a student of philosophy, politics and economics at the LSE.

I write on [Substack](https://matthewlhchiu.substack.com/).

This website is a collection of my disparate thoughts and notes. I hope you find them helpful.

Contact me: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/matthewlhchiu), [Linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/matthewlhchiu), and Gmail (the domain of this website).

And here is a [presentation](<files/Data Science Revolutions presentation.pdf>) that I worked on.
