I co-founded [Protopia Group](https://protopiagroup.org/), a non-profit think tank focussed on developing innovation systems worldwide. If you're interested in working on the pressing issue of catalysing global innovation, please reach out.

I studied Philosophy, Politics, and Economics at the LSE.
