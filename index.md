# Welcome
Thank you for visiting my small corner of the Internet world.

## My work
**What's new:** I am founding [Protopia Group](https://protopiagroup.org/), a think tank for young professionals and students to research ideas for better innovation. If you're interested in working on the pressing issue of catalysing global economic growth, please reach out.

**Writing:** My blog, [*All That Glitters*](https://matthewlhchiu.substack.com/), examines how we can get more of the things that matter in life.

**Pursuits:** Currently a final year philosophy, politics and economics at LSE, where I am blessed with the opportunity to think deeply about many problems.
