# Welcome
Thank you for visiting my small corner of the Internet.

## My work
**Building something new:** I am founding [Protopia Group](https://protopiagroup.org/), a think tank for young professionals and students to research ideas for better innovation. If you're interested in working on the pressing issue of catalyzing global economic growth, please reach out!

**Writing:** My blog, [*All That Glitters*](https://matthewlhchiu.substack.com/), examines how we can get more of the things that matter in life.

**My background:** I'm currently a final-year student in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics at the LSE, where I am blessed with the opportunity to think deeply about many interesting problems.

## Other
**Travels:** I'm curating a list of religious sites known for their unique architectural features, which I've had the fortune of visiting.
